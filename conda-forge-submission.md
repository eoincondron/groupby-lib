### 2. Publish to PyPI (Recommended)
While not strictly required, having your package on PyPI makes the conda-forge submission easier:

```bash
# Build and upload to PyPI
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```

## Submission Process

### Step 1: Fork staged-recipes
1. Go to https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes
2. Click "Fork" to create your fork

### Step 2: Create Recipe Branch
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/staged-recipes.git
cd staged-recipes

# Create new branch
git checkout -b kungfu-pandas-recipe

# Create recipe directory
mkdir recipes/kungfu-pandas
cp /path/to/kungfu-pandas/conda-forge-recipe/meta.yaml recipes/kungfu-pandas/
```

### Step 3: Test Recipe Locally (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# Install conda-smithy
conda install conda-smithy

# Lint the recipe
cd recipes/kungfu-pandas
conda smithy recipe-lint .

# Build locally (if you have conda-build)
conda build .
```

### Step 4: Submit Pull Request
1. Commit and push your changes:
```bash
git add recipes/kungfu-pandas/
git commit -m "Add kungfu-pandas recipe"
git push origin kungfu-pandas-recipe
```

2. Go to your fork on GitHub and create a Pull Request
3. In the PR description, mention: `@conda-forge/help-python` to request review from Python team

### Step 5: Address Review Feedback
The conda-forge team will review and may request changes. Common requests:
- Update dependencies versions
- Fix recipe formatting
- Add more comprehensive tests
- Update metadata

## Recipe Details

The prepared recipe (`conda-forge-recipe/meta.yaml`) includes:
- ✅ Source from GitHub v0.2.2 release with SHA256 hash
- ✅ Python >=3.10 requirement
- ✅ All runtime dependencies (numpy, pandas, numba, polars)
- ✅ Proper test imports and commands
- ✅ Complete metadata (license, homepage, summary)
- ✅ Entry point for CLI command

## Next Steps After Acceptance

Once your recipe is accepted:
1. A new repository `kungfu-pandas-feedstock` will be created
2. You'll be added as a maintainer
3. Future updates can be automated via bots or manual PRs to the feedstock
4. Your package will be available via: `conda install -c conda-forge kungfu-pandas`
